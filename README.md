On October 30th, 2018 Apple held an [event](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2018/) in New York, announcing new iPad Pros, MacBook Air and Mac mini.
For the invites to the press Apple commissioned [hundreds of interesting and creative logos](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/24/all-the-apple-logos/). It feels like a waste of amazing creativity to not do anything more permanent with this art. 

October 30 is a macOS screen saver (requires El Capitan or later) that randomly changes between these 371 Apple logos.

_(The GIF above is just for intro. Actually logos change smoothly and more slowly.)_

### Install
* [**Download the Screen Saver**](https://github.com/lekevicius/october30/raw/master/Release/October30.saver.zip)
* Right-click October30.saver and choose "Open" (otherwise macOS might not let you install it)
* Choose to Install just for your own user or everyone using the Mac
* Enjoy üçé

### F.A.Q
<details>
  <summary>I am on MacOS 10+ and I get the error "October30.saver can't be opened because Apple cannot check it fot malicious software"</summary>
    You have 2 ways:
  <ol>
    <li>go under System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General tab. In the lower area it will say that you can't open October30.saver because it's from an unidentified developer. Select "Open Anyway".</li>
    <li>open your terminal and if you installed the screensaver only for your user give the command <pre>xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Users/yourUsername/Library/Screen\ Savers/October30.saver</pre> If you installed it for all users, than give <pre>xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Library/Screen\ Savers/October30.saver</pre></li>
  </ol>
